    longDescription: 'I developed a project called Advanced Inventory System fully built in Microsoft Access. This system was designed to streamline inventory management and improve operational efficiency through well-defined user roles and automation. The entire system was created within Microsoft Access, utilizing its built-in features for database structure, forms, queries, and reports, while leveraging VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) for custom logic, automation, and enhanced user interaction. It integrates inventory tracking, data imports, role-based access, and reportingâ€”all within a single, user-friendly Access application.',
